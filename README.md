# PositionControl 
### This library can be used to control the position DC mnotor with feedback from quadrature encoders. Here it will generate the required PWM control signal for this, but one can change the control signal, as per their requirement. The driver that this motor uses to control the speed is a speed controller. Here the accuracy of the control can be controlled. This can be useful in cases where there is unavailability of servo driver.

### Requirement for the library
-   [Encoder](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder)
-   [AutoPID](https://github.com/r-downing/AutoPID)

Please install theses library to use this library as this library uses some of these components for speed control.

### Look into the example to get started with the library
